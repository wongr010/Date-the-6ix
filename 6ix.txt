Animal Fair Media\u2019s Wendy Diamond is hosting the first ever \u201cHound High Tea\u201d in history this July. Dames, Dapper men and Dogs will be sipping refined tea and eating tasty finger sandwich treats for a good cause! All proceeds from the event will benefit The Humane Society of New York's Lucky Diamond Critical Care Ward.\n\nWendy\u2019s beloved sidekick of more than 12 years passed last July from canine spleen cancer. In Lucky\u2019s honor, Wendy created and hosted The Most Expensive Pet Wedding in History, which earned her a Guinness World Record for the Most Expensive Wedding.\n\n\nThe event paid tribute to Lucky\u2019s service, and the countless animals she helped to find a loving home over the past decade. All proceeds from the event were donated to the creation of The Humane Society of New York\u2019s Lucky Diamond Critical Care Ward. The critical care ward will carry on Lucky\u2019s legacy of saving and helping animals in dire need, and provide pet parents and animals affordable critical health care that they might not have received otherwise.\n\nWendy Diamond is the perfect animal advocate and pet-lifestyle expert to celebrate a high tea; her mother was born and raised in the UK! Not only that, Wendy was awarded a Guinness World Record for the Longest Curtsy Relay - the Queen would be proud. And for those of you wondering if dogs should even drink tea, no worries, Wendy will be serving an exclusive special tea designed and brewed for canines only!\n\n!\n\nWendy\u2019s bark story started in 1999, after she adopted her Russian Blue cat, Pasha and Maltese, Lucky. She was inspired to create Animal Fair Media, and became the premiere entrepreneur to combine the pet industry, animal rescue, celebrity, and media! Wendy Diamond coined the term \u201cpet lifestyle\u201d and designed a career through her passion for helping animals and business. When she started Animal Fair Media the number of animals euthanized annually in the U.S. dropped by 58%, from 12 million to 5 million.\n\nWendy was inspired to create premiere benefits featuring guest appearances by celebrities, with  proceeds benefiting animal rescue organizations across the country/world. These events include; Paws For Style, Yappy Hour, Halloween Pet Costume Party and Toys For Dogs. Animal Organizations all over the world have emuliated these events to raise money and awareness for the benefit of animal rescue and welfare.\n\nThe \u201cHound High Tea\u201d charity event will celebrate with 200 dog parents, animal rescue advocates, business leaders, celebrities, and media personalities that believe in giving back. Their dogs will eagerly join them for high tea and yummy treats! You never know we may even receive another Guinness World Record for the largest Hound High tea Party In History!","id":"330488900405820"},{"start_time":"2017-10-11T19:00:00+1030","end_time":"2017-10-11T21:00:00+1030","name":"Samsung Diamonds v New Zealand Silver Ferns","description":"The Constellation Cup hits Australian shores when the Samsung Diamonds host the Silver Ferns in the third test of the Series.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s best netball talent will be ready to battle, with spectators being treated to an electrifying atmosphere and a close rivalry.","place":{"name":"Titanium Security Arena","location":{"zip":"5023","country":"Australia","city":"Findon","street":"44A Crittenden Road","latitude":-34.900292483442,"state":"SA","longitude":138.54628252864},"id":"393981164066544"},"id":"1928763267370902"},{"start_time":"2017-10-17T18:00:00+0100","end_time":"2017-10-19T23:00:00+0100","name":"Neil Diamond at The O2 arena","description":"Neil Diamond returns to The O2 with The 50th Anniversary Tour.

Die Songs kommen live oftmals kraftvoller daher, als man es sich von den Alben her gewohnt ist, da und dort gekonnt mit einer eigenen Note versehen. \n\nDas im 2016 erschienene Dreifachalbum \u201eLive at Augusta Raurica\u201c, von Presse und Fans hochgelobt, repräsentiert eindrücklich das akribische Schaffen der Eidgenossen, deren Wirken übrigens bis ins Floyd-Lager nach London durchgedrungen ist. \n\nCrazy Diamond ist keine 0815 Hitfabrik. Klassiker wie Time oder Wish you were here dürfen natürlich nicht fehlen. Immer wieder aber gräbt die Band längst vergessene Perlen aus, die selbst die Original-Floyds seit Urzeiten nicht mehr spielen. \n\nFür ihren Auftritt im Kofmehl rührt die Band mit grosser Kehle an. Nebst fettem Sound darf eine intelligente Lichtshow, untermalt mit eindrücklichen Visuals, nicht fehlen. Die Zuhörer kommen in den Genuss von 200% Pink Floyd!\n\nTicketpreis:\nCHF 38 (inkl.

Terwijl hij vandaag zijn eigen 76ste verjaardag viert, kondigt hij aan dat de tournee naar aanleiding van de 50ste verjaardag van zijn carrière nu ook naar Europa komt. De \u201850th Anniversary Tour\u2019 houdt op donderdag 28 september halt in het Sportpaleis.\n\nNeil Diamond is één groot succesverhaal. Een Grammy Award, een Golden Globe, een opname in de Songwriters Hall of Fame en in 2011 zelfs nog in de Rock and Roll Hall of Fame en ook de zéér prestigieuze Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award; Diamond heeft het allemaal op zijn naam staan. De Amerikaanse levende legende heeft zijn internationale succes te danken aan zijn charisma, een ijzersterke live reputatie en natuurlijk een berg onsterfelijke hits. \"Sweet Caroline\", \"Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon\", \"Solitary Man\", \"I Am...I Said\", \"Cracklin' Rosie\"... De lijst is eindeloos, de songs tijdloos.\n\n5 decennia actief in de muziekindustrie. Dat is een jubileum dat Neil Diamond op gepaste manier wil vieren. Hij brengt daarom de \u201850th Anniversary Collection\u2019 uit, een unieke verzameling van 50 zorgvuldig geselecteerde eigen songs uit 50 jaar carrière.
